# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
This repository will contain my work from the Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. I will be implementing solutions in  C++ only. This is a 6 course specialization targetted towards undergraduate level. The course instructors are Alexander S. Kuikov, Michael Levin, Neil Rhodes, Pavel Pevzner, Daniel M Kane and is being offered by the University of California San Diego. This repository is targetted to those who are stuck in a problem for a very long time and couldn't find a reference solution. Please use the solution as a reference and not directly copy the work as it would not only be against Coursera rule but also will hamper your learning experience. ALso i have inluded the problem statements. Currently this is a work in progress and contains solutions from th 1st Course. Moreover, I haven't included solutions to first few week as they contains very easy problems. Also in future as I progress, i won't include solutions for easier and basic problems. **Please give your best shot and try as hard as you can then only look into the solutions. If you find any issues or a better more optimized way to solve the problems, do contact me.
