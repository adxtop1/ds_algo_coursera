# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
This repository will contain my work from the Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. I will be implementing solutions in  C++ only. This is a 6 course specialization targetted towards undergraduate level. The course instructors are Alexander S. Kuikov, Michael Levin, Neil Rhodes, Pavel Pevzner, Daniel M Kane and is being offered by the University of California San Diego. This repository is targetted to those who are stuck in a problem for a very long time and couldn't find a reference solution. Please use the solution as a reference and not directly copy the work as it would not only be against Coursera rule but also will hamper your learning experience. Also i have included the problem statements. Currently this is a work in progress and contains solutions from th 1st and 2nd Course. **Please give your best shot and try as hard as you can to find the solution by yourself, then only look into the solutions. Trust me the efforts that you put in is not wasted.** If you find any issues or a better more optimized way to solve the problems, do contact me.
