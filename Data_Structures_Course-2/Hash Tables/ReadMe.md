For the third problem, substring equality, I was getting Time Limit Exceeded by the Online Judge. Tough the logic implemented was correct, but still it was giving a TLE. I first implemented it in C++. After many unsucessful attempts, I changed the language and implemented it in python. Still no luck. Though I found Python implementation a little simpler so I am uploading this one. Anyway if you find a better soultion than this one, please contact. Also, since their was an error in this question, I didn't do other question because they depenedent on this question in one way or the other.
